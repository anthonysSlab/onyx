# Code Style
> Fully qualify paths if an object or module are used only once in a file.

> Don't merge all imports from a library into one `use`; eg:
> ```
> use std::{
>     fs,
>     io::{self, Read, Write},
>     collections::{HashMap, VecDeque},
> };
> ```
> Instead, split these into multiple.

> If a lifetime must annotate more than one field/var, it should likely be expended to a more useful name;
> Don't call them a 1 letter long name like `'a`.  
> The impl block should use the same lifetime names as the object. Don't shorten them.

> Trivial lifetimes *may* be described using a single letter, however try avoiding using an alphabetic order for lifetimes
> `'a`, `'b`, `'c`. Instead use a letter 
<br>

> Dont end `match` and `if` blocks with a semicolon, unless required.
